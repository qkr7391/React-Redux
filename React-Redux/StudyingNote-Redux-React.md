# React-Redux

---

- React: a technology that allows you to create systematic and well-organized applications by creating custom tags, i.e. components.

- Redux: a technology that reduces the possibility of data being transformed in an unpredictable direction by centrally managing the state.

- Technology that reduces the complexity of development.

- React is like a rumor.
  React is like a society made up of components, and if a change occurs (data representing the change is generated), the change is transmitted to all components. --> Performance deteriorates because the render function is called.

- As applications become more complex, it becomes more difficult to construct them using only React.

- Redux is like media.
  When a change occurs, the change can be easily communicated by notifying the media outlet called Redux's store.

- However, both have the inefficiency of being delivered to members who do not need it.

- Therefore, by using React-Redux, a library that connects React and Redux, the news can be delivered only to the members who need it.

## Study Plan

1. simple react component structure without redux

2. react component state connect without redux

3. Add redux
