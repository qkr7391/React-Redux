# New version React

---

## Install

Using **[npx create-react-app my-app]**, install create-react-app
Using **[npm start]** to run the code.

## Edit

1. index.js: The index.js file is the entry point to your React application. It primarily serves the following purposes.

```
1.1 Calling ReactDOM.render(): Renders React elements to the real DOM via the React DOM library's ReactDOM.render() function.

1.2 Render the <App /> component (a feature of App.js discussed below) inside a DOM element with an id of 'root' in index.html

1.3 Typically, this file imports the necessary components and libraries, and performs initialization tasks.
```

2. App.js: The App.js file is primarily used as the root component of an application

```
2.1 Define and export React components. They are typically written as class or functional components.

2.2 It primarily combines and organizes other components to create the layout and structure of the overall app. Within this file, other components are called and combined to create the UI.

2.3 Used in conjunction with React Router or another state management library, it can be responsible for things like routing configuration or state management for your app.
```

- Index.js is the entry point for rendering and launching your app, while App.js is responsible for defining and organizing the main components of your application. Both play an important role in a React application, and work together to make up the entire app.

## Deployment

An application run with **[npm start]** is a development application. It is good for development, but it is not suitable for use in a real service because it is large and contains such as unnecessary messages.

If so, can you create an efficient application for your service?

In the terminal, type **[npm run build]** to start the build command.

he npm run build command is typically used before deploying a React application. When you run it, it creates a set of static files that are optimized for the production environment.

**Key features:**

- Generate optimized builds: optimize and bundle source code to reduce size and improve performance. This is done by minimizing CSS, JavaScript, and image files and generating them in the build directory.

- Static file generation: During development with tools like **create-react-app**, there may be unused files or code. **[npm run build]** removes these unnecessary pieces and bundles the necessary files together.

- Apply environment settings: There are settings required for production that are different from development. For example, Source Maps are usually disabled in production builds.

- Generate deliverables: When the build is complete, a series of static files are generated. These files can be deployed to a web server to host your application, or uploaded to a CDN to make them accessible to users.

The output generated by the **[npm run build]** command is usually stored in the _build_ or _dist_ directory, which makes your app available for deployment. These built files are not the source code, but rather the version that will be delivered to end users, which is smaller in size and optimized for better performance.

**[npx serve -s build]**

The npx serve -s build command runs a simple local web server that serves the production-built files of your project. This allows you to test the production build of the application you're developing locally. After building that project, running this command will allow you to preview the application locally.
